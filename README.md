# Pawlette
A prototype for an art gallery website. This website uses Vue and CSS custom properties, but is otherwise vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Trello
Here's a link to the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/QGumIcAf/pawlette) for planning this project.

## YAFS
[NurbsOtter](https://github.com/NurbsOtter) is creating a RESTful API backend for this project based on Node and Express called [YAFS](https://github.com/NurbsOtter/yafs), or "Yet Another Furry Site".

## Hot Reloading Server
Run `live-server` in the CLI, and it will automatically open the site in http://localhost:8080/.
